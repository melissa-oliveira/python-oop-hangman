## Description

This project is part of the Python for Data Analysis and Data Science course offered by Data Science Academy. It serves as an initial training for introduction to object-oriented programming in Python, by creating a modularized hangman game.

## Features

- Modularized code
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Basic file handling

## Installation

To run the game, you need to have Python 3.x installed. Clone the repository and run the following command in the terminal:
